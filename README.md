# SQ-DiffuPep
# Abstract
Microbial drug resistance poses an increasing threat to global health, making the discovery of new antimicrobial agents imperative. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)—proteins occurring naturally across various organisms—have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents. While deep generative models have recently made strides in drug discovery, AMP generation remains largely dependent on autoregressive models, often disregarding the crucial structural information inherent to proteins. This oversight constrains both the activity and diversity of generated peptide sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce SQ-DiffuPep, an innovative quantitative latent diffusion model tailored for AMP generation based on the paradigm of structure-determined functionality. SQ-DiffuPep initially learns comprehensive representations of both sequence and structural attributes of peptides in a latent space, where the model then diffuses over aligned joint representations of AMPs. By learning this inverse diffusion process, SQ-DiffuPep enables the generation of peptides endowed with both chemical and structural fidelity. Extensive experiments on six publicly available AMP predictors demonstrate that SQ-DiffuPep surpasses state-of-the-art models in generating sequences with superior antimicrobial activity and novelty. This work enhances the application of machine learning in AMP design, advancing the development of effective antimicrobial therapies.
